            It started with me wanting to tweak a few values in my Frosthaven campaign. Maybe give myself a bit more
            gold, or adjust a character's stats. Sounds easy, right? I thought so too.

            I quickly realized that the game's ruleset file is incredibly strict. You can't just open it in a text
            editor and change a number. The file structure relies on precise byte conversions and is incredibly fragile
            if anything is shifted.

            If you change a value, and end up turning a 1-byte integer into a 2-byte integer, you have to
            recalculate and adjust the file size perfectly. If you miss by a single byte, the whole file corrupts and
            the game won't load. Oh, and this can't just be done in a text editor, because you aren't guaranteed to get
            the same amount of bytes, even if you add/remove the same number of characters. This has to be done in a
            hex editor, where you can see and control the exact byte values, or by altering the file on
            byte-level/ISO-8859-1 encoding.
            <br><br>
            Knowing this, I suddenly faced a big issue. To compensate for added bytes when increasing values, I would
            have to
            find bytes to remove elsewhere in the file. This took me a lot of trial and error, but at some point, while
            staring at the file in a hex editor, I noticed something interesting.<br>
            I noticed that every line ended with double linebreaks (0D 0A). This is the standard for Windows
            text files, however, in most cases, a single break is sufficient.
            After some testing, I confirmed that I could just compensate for extra bytes added by removing one of these
            linebreaks. The file is about 250,000 lines long, and the actual content section is about 100,000, so
            there's plenty of bytes to play with...

            I'll be honest, this project gave me more headaches than I care to admit. As a first-year student, this code
            became much more advanced than I was prepared for.
            <br><br>
            In the end, I learned a lot about file handling, byte conversions, and Java programming in general.
            I hope you find this program useful, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out on
            GitHub.
