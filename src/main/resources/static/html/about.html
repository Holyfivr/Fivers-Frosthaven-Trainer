        So you want to know more about this program?
        <br>
        This program is made to manage and edit the Frosthaven ruleset files more easily.<br>
        <br>Currently it is limited to editing character values, but in future versions, you will be able to:
        </div>
        <div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: left;">
            <ul>
                <li>Add starting characters</li>
                <li>Edit item costs and values</li>
                <li>Edit ability card values</li>
                <li>Edit enchant costs and values</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
        <div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; width:500px;">
        I'm a first year student, studying java (among other things), aspiring to become a software developer. I made this program as a personal
        project to help me learn more about programming and software development. I'm still very much a novice, and I
        have a lot of school stuff to work on (like, a lot!), so please bare with me if updates are slow.
