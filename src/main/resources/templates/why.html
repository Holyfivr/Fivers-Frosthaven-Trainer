            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>It started with me wanting to tweak a few values in my Frosthaven campaign. Maybe give myself a bit more
                gold, or adjust a character's stats. Sounds easy, right? <b>Wrong.</b></p>

            <p>The game's ruleset file is incredibly strict.
                This isn't the kind of file you can just open in Notepad, change a number, hit save, and call it a day.
                The game relies on the file having an <i>exact</i> byte structure.
                If that structure shifts, even by a single byte, the entire file becomes corrupted and the game simply
                won't load.</p>

            <p>Now, you might say <i>“Just don't add extra characters. If a value is one digit, keep it one digit and that
                    should be fine, right?”</i> <b>Nope.</b></p>

            <p>The problem is that characters and bytes are not the same thing.
                Modern text editors use UTF-8 encoding, which means that what looks like a single character
                can take up a different number of bytes depending on its value and context.
                Even changing a number from one digit to another, without adding or removing characters,
                can still change the file's byte size.</p>

            <p>On top of that, some values can be stored as signed integers, others as unsigned.
                So a value that <i>looks</i> safe to change might require more bytes internally.
                This means you're never guaranteed a 1:1 byte replacement when editing the file in a normal text editor.
                Even if the visible text looks identical in length, the underlying byte data may not be.</p>

            <p>That's why this can't reliably be done in Notepad or similar tools.
                To do it safely, you either need a hex editor, where you can see and control the exact byte values, or you
                need to edit the file at the byte level using a single-byte encoding like ISO-8859-1.</p>

            <p>Once I understood this, I ran into the real challenge.</p>

            <p>If increasing a value adds bytes to the file, those bytes have to be removed somewhere else.
            The total file size must remain <i>exactly</i> the same, and this has to be done without altering the files
            internal structure.</p>

            <p>While examining the file in a hex editor, I noticed something interesting.
                Every line in the file ends with a Windows-style line break: <code>0D 0A</code>.
                In most cases, only one of those bytes is actually necessary.</p>

            <p>After testing, I confirmed that I could safely "steal" bytes by removing one of these line breaks
                to compensate for bytes added elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Considering the file is around 250,000 lines long, with roughly 100,000 lines of editable content,
                there turned out to be plenty of bytes to work with.</p>

            <p>That discovery is what made this tool possible.</p>
            
            <p>I'll be honest, this project gave me more headaches than I care to admit. As a first-year student, this code
                became much more advanced than I was prepared for.</p>

            <p>However, during this journey, I've learned a lot about file handling, byte conversions, and Java programming in general.
                I hope you find this program useful, and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out on
                GitHub.</p>
